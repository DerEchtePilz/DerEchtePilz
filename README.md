# DerEchtePilz

Hi, I am DerEchtePilz!

My current project is called **Infinity**! Currently it is a private repository but as soon as it is public you can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/DerEchtePilz/Infinity)

I am also currently contributing to the [CommandAPI](https://github.com/JorelAli/CommandAPI), a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper command framework that uses Brigadier to create better commands.
